# ♻️ Recycling Robot VI-PI

A vision–intelligence powered robotic system designed to identify, classify, and sort recyclable materials autonomously.  
This repository contains the implementation, training notebooks, and experiments for the **Recycling Robot VI-PI** project.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
Recycling processes often require significant human effort and suffer from inefficiencies in sorting.  
The **Recycling Robot VI-PI** leverages computer vision, robotics, and AI-based decision-making to:
- Detect recyclable materials in real-time.
- Classify objects into categories (plastic, metal, paper, glass, etc.).
- Automate physical sorting actions using a robotic manipulator or conveyor system.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Computer Vision Models**: Deep learning pipelines for object detection and classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Augmentation, normalization, and dataset preparation.
- **Training & Evaluation**: Notebook-based experiments with performance metrics.
- **Integration**: Robotics control layer for actuation (arm/gripper or conveyor).
- **Visualization**: Real-time detection overlay and confusion matrix tracking.
